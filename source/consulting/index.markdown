David Condon and I are available as a statistical consulting team.  We are highly proficient in writing analyses and packages in [R](http://cran.rstudio.org/), an open-source statistical computing language.  Using R packages such as [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/), we can help you break down complex interactions to make yours results visually appealing to the broadest audience.  Our services have been provided to graduate students, professors, and businesses.
