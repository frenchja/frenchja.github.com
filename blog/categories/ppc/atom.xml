    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This guide is intended to faciliate the installation of up-to-date R packages
for users new to either R or Linux.  Unlike Windows binaries or Mac packages,
Linux software is often distributed as source-code and then compiled by package
maintainers.  The use of package managers has many advantages that I won't
discuss here (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_management_system">Wikipedia</a>).<br/>
More importantly, the difference can be initially intimidating.<br/>
However, once the user gets used to using package managers such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool">apt</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowdog_Updater,_Modified">yum</a> to install software,
I'm confident they'll appreciate their ease of use.</p>

<p>These instructions are organized by system type.</p>

<h2>Debian-based Distributions</h2>

<h3>Ubuntu</h3>

<p>Full installation instructions for Ubuntu can be found
<a href="http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ubuntu/">here</a>.  Luckily, CRAN mirrors have
compiled binaries of R which can be installed using the apt-get package manager.
To accomplish this, we'll first add the <a href="http://cran.us.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/">CRAN
repo</a> for Ubuntu packages to
<code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>.  If you prefer to manually edit the sources.list file,
you can do so by issuing the following in the terminal:</p>

<p><code>bash Inspecting sources.list
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
</code></p>

<p>``` bash Installing R in Ubuntu</p>

<h1>Grabs your version of Ubuntu as a BASH variable</h1>

<p>CODENAME=<code>grep CODENAME /etc/lsb-release | cut -c 18-</code></p>

<h1>Appends the CRAN repository to your sources.list file</h1>

<p>sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ubuntu $CODENAME" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'</p>

<h1>Adds the CRAN GPG key, which is used to sign the R packages for security.</h1>

<p>sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E084DAB9</p>

<p>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install r-base r-dev
```</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Debian</h3>

<p>The instructions for installing R in Debian are similar to Ubuntu.  Regarding 'stable'
versions of Debian, the CRAN
<a href="http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/debian/README.html">README file</a> for Debian
points out:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>After a release of Debian "stable", no new packages get added by<br/>Debian to keep the release as 'stable' as possible. This implies that the R<br/>release contained in the official Debian release will become outdated as time<br/>passes.</p><footer><strong>CRAN</strong> <cite><a href='http://cran.us.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian/README.html'>README</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Thus, we'll append the CRAN repository to the Debian list to update the available R version, just like
we did for Ubuntu:</p>

<p>``` bash Installing R in Debian Stable</p>

<h1>Appends the CRAN repository to your sources.list file</h1>

<p>sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/debian lenny-cran/" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'</p>

<h1>Adds the CRAN GPG key, which is used to sign the R packages for security.</h1>

<p>sudo apt-key adv --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --recv-key 381BA480
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev
```</p>

<p>Finally, you can search for additional R packages in terminal using <code>apt-cache</code>:
<code>bash Searching for R packages using apt-get
apt-cache search ^r-.*
</code></p>

<h3>Installing RStudio</h3>

<p>Rstudio is a cross-platform user interface for R. The
RStudio package is compiled for both Debian and Ubuntu distributions.
Therefore, the installation instructions are the same.  Copy the link for the
latest RStudio package from <a href="http:/%0A/www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop">http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop</a> (e.g., <a href="http://download1.rstudio.org/rstudio-0.97.320-amd64.deb">http://download1.rstudio.org/rstudio-0.97.320-amd64.deb</a>
).</p>

<p><code>bash Installing RStudio using apt-get
sudo apt-get install http://download1.rstudio.org/rstudio-0.97.320-amd64.deb
</code></p>

<h2>RedHat-based Distributions</h2>

<h3>RedHat EL6 (or CentOS 6+)</h3>

<p>In order to get R running on RHEL 6, we'll need to add an additional repository
that allows us to install the new packages, EPEL.  <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL">Extra Packages for
Enterprise Linux</a> (or EPEL) is a Fedora
Special Interest Group that creates, maintains, and manages a high quality set
of additional packages for Enterprise Linux, including, but not limited to, Red
Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS and Scientific Linux (SL).</p>

<p>``` bash Installing EPEL and R</p>

<h1>For El5 or CentOS 5</h1>

<p>su -c 'rpm -Uvh http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm'
sudo yum update
sudo yum install R</p>

<h1>For El6 or CentOS 6</h1>

<p>su -c 'rpm -Uvh http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm'
sudo yum update
sudo yum install R
```</p>

<p>Finally, you can search for additional R packages in terminal using <code>yum</code>:
<code>bash Searching for R packages using yum
yum list R-\*
</code></p>

<h3>Fedora</h3>

<p>For Fedora, life is much easier.  Current versions of Fedora have an up-to-date build of R in their repositories.</p>

<p><code>bash Installing R in Fedora
sudo yum update
sudo yum install R
</code></p>

<h3>Installing RStudio</h3>

<p>You'll want to copy the appropriate link for your system from the <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop">RStudio Desktop Download</a> page.  In my case, it was <code>http://download1.rstudio.org/rstudio-0.97.320-x86_64.rpm</code>.</p>

<p><code>bash Installing RStudio on Fedora/RHEL/CentOS
sudo yum install http://download1.rstudio.org/rstudio-0.97.320-x86_64.rpm
</code></p>

<h1>Dealing with PPC-based Systems</h1>

<p>As our lab has a lot of old iMacs that are still quite useful, I've recently
dealt with the best way to support R on these machines.  These machines are
still quite useful, particulary when their maximum potential RAM is installed.
However, Apple stopped supporting the machines after OS 10.5.8 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple%27s_transition_to_Intel_processors">see here</a>).
While the <a href="http://r.research.att.com/">nightly packages</a> distributed do install
on PPC machines with OS X, they lack the R Framework compiled for PPC, meaning
that it's a useless installation.  This means that a user stuck on OS X 10.5.8
is tied to R 2.10, a very old R distribution that's incompatible with many
existing packages.</p>

<h2>Any solutions?</h2>

<p>My first solution was to compile R from source using
<a href="https://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>, a package manager similar in concept to
<code>yum</code> or <code>apt-get</code>.  While successful, it takes a <em>long</em>, <em>long</em>, time to build
R and its necessary dependencies on a 1.8 Ghz G5 processor.  From a system
administrator's perspective, this also is the least parsimonious solution
possible, since each machine has to be updated with each new release of R.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/server/getting_started">RStudio Server</a>, each machine
doesn't need to have R installed, as it can be run off a more powerful server
and accessed using a reasonably up-to-date browser.  I was able to install R and
RStudio on our RedHat EL6 server easily.  The trick was to make this as seemless
as possible from the user's perspective.  To accomplish this, I saved the
Bookmark to the Desktop.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://gradstudents.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jaf502/images/ppc-r-bookmark.png" title="R Bookmark" ></p>

<p>Next, I downloaded a large R icon using Google Images and edited the Bookmark's
icon to appear as if it were R.  To do this, just copy the R icon from within
Preview, select the icon of the Bookmark by right-clicking and selecting Get
Info, and pasting using <code>Command+V</code>.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://gradstudents.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jaf502/images/ppc-r-preview.png" width="300" title="R Preview" ></p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://gradstudents.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jaf502/images/ppc-r-getinfo.png" title="Get Info" ></p>

<p>Finally, this was dragged to the OS X dock, appearing just as if it were R on the local machine, but without all the hassle and slow load times on PPC.</p>

<p><img src="http://gradstudents.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jaf502/images/ppc-r-dock.png" title="Fake Dock Icon" ></p>

<p>It is worth noting that this solution is only important for users tied to OS X
10.5.8.  I've had great success with using <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/PowerPC?rd=Arch:PPC">Fedora's PPC build</a>, which
has packages compiled for PPC already.  However, as Linux is intimidating for
many users, I chose to install RStudio Server on our lab server.</p>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I get an error that says I'm <code>not in the sudoers file</code>:  This means that you don't have access to install software on your machine.  Talk to your system administrator.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't know if I'm running Ubuntu or Fedora.  How do I know which instructions to use?  Jokes aside, run <code>lsb_release -irc</code> in your terminal.</p></li>
